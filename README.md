# 📊 Business Insights 360 – AtliQ Hardware

AtliQ Hardware is expanding rapidly and has decided to implement data analytics for the first time to stay ahead of competitors and enable **data-driven decisions**.

This project was built by following the [Codebasics Power BI Course](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project), where I applied all the concepts step-by-step to create a professional business dashboard using real-world datasets.
